# .netcoreSignInApi
I am done with .net core(3.1) sign-in api. Code is in the following git repository;-
https://github.com/iarunkverma/.netcoreSignInApi
I used jwt token based authentication to secure the api.
There are two api controller in Application
•	AuthenticateController (http://localhost:49588/api/authenticate)
•	WeatherforecastController(http://localhost:49588/weatherforecast) it is default controller generated by .net, I made it secure by putting [Authorize] attribute.

To get the token you need to sent a post request to AuthenticateController with username(admin) and password(admin123) parameters. 
 
After getting the token you can pass this token as the bearer token to access the Weatherforecast api.
